# Driver Drowsiness Detection and Driver Monitoring System

An AI-powered Driver Monitoring System that detects drowsiness, fatigue, yawning, driver distraction, and mobile phone usage in real time using a standard webcam.

## Features

### 👁️ Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- Real-time eye openness monitoring
- Independent left and right eye analysis
- Adaptive thresholds for each driver
- Personalized calibration

### 📊 PERCLOS Monitoring
- 120-second rolling window
- Measures percentage of eye closure over time
- Driver state classification:
  - ALERT
  - FATIGUE
  - DROWSY
  - HIGH RISK

### 😴 Drowsiness Detection
- Detects prolonged eye closure
- Visual and audio alerts
- Personalized thresholds based on calibration

### 🥱 Yawn Detection
- Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) calculation
- Real-time yawn monitoring
- False-positive reduction using cooldown logic

### 🚗 Driver Distraction Detection
- Head pose estimation
- Detects looking away from the road
- Real-time warning system

### 📱 Mobile Phone Detection
- MediaPipe Hand Tracking
- YOLOv8 Phone Detection
- Phone usage timer
- Alert for prolonged phone usage while driving

### 🌙 Low-Light Monitoring
- Brightness measurement
- Gamma correction
- CLAHE enhancement
- Lighting status indicator

### 👤 Driver Profile System
- Saves individual driver calibration
- Personalized EAR thresholds
- Automatic profile loading
- JSON-based profile storage
